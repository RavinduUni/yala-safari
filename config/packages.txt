CATEGORY A: PRIVATE ALL INCLUSIVE

1.Private All-Inclusive Morning Safari
The Golden Hour Predator Quest: Exclusive Dawn Expedition
1. Package Overview
The Private All-Inclusive Morning Safari is our flagship experience for wildlife photographers and enthusiasts who want to see Yala National Park at its most vibrant. Starting before dawn, this package is strategically timed to coincide with the "Golden Hour"—the first two hours of light when the park’s apex predators are most active.
As a Private tour, you have the entire 4x4 jeep to yourself. As an All-Inclusive package, we handle every logistical detail: from hotel pickup and park entrance tickets to a gourmet picnic breakfast. You simply show up, and we provide the adventure.

2. All-Inclusive Pricing Structure
We believe in 100% transparency. Our pricing is tiered by group size to ensure you get the best value.

3. The Morning Itinerary
05:00 AM – The Pre-Dawn Pickup: Our driver-tracker collects you from your hotel in Tissamaharama, Kirinda, or Kataragama.
05:45 AM – The Gate Ritual: We arrive at the Palatupana (Block 1) or Katagamuwa gate. Being early in the queue is essential for the best sightings.
06:00 AM – The Grand Entry: As the gates open, we enter the park just as the sun begins to peek over the Indian Ocean.
06:00 AM – 08:30 AM – Peak Predator Tracking: We focus on the rocky outcrops and sandy tracks where leopards mark their territory.
08:30 AM – The Riverside Breakfast: We stop at the Manik River or Patanangala Beach for a fresh picnic breakfast.
09:00 AM – 10:30 AM – The Wetland Circuit: Exploring the lagoons for crocodiles, elephants, and rare aquatic birds.
11:00 AM – Return: We drop you back at your hotel in time for a midday rest.

4. Why the Morning Safari is Superior for Leopards
The Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is crepuscular, meaning it is most active at dawn and dusk. In the early morning:
Fresh Pugmarks: The sandy tracks are undisturbed, allowing our trackers to read the "morning newspaper" of the jungle—tracking fresh footprints from the night before.
Territorial Patrol: Leopards often use the cooling sand of the roads to travel before the sun makes the ground too hot.
The Sloth Bear Factor: Morning is the best time to see the elusive Sloth Bear foraging for termites or Palu fruit before they retreat into the thick scrub for the day.

5. Our Vehicle & Tracker Standards
We do not use standard road vehicles. Your safari is conducted in a Heavy-Duty 4x4 Safari Jeep (TATA or Mahindra) specifically modified for the rugged Yala terrain.
Tiered Seating: All rows are elevated so the person in the back sees over the person in the front.
Open Canopy: 360-degree unobstructed views for photography.
Safety First: Equipped with reinforced roll cages and first aid kits.
The Naturalist Driver: Your driver is a trained tracker who knows how to listen for Langur alarm calls and Spotted Deer barks to locate hidden predators.

6. What to Pack & Preparation
To ensure a comfortable 5-hour journey, we recommend:
Clothing: Wear earth tones (Khaki, Green, Brown). The morning can be chilly in an open jeep; bring a light jacket or pashmina.
Photography: A lens with a focal length of 300mm or higher is ideal. Don't forget a lens cloth for the dust!
Health: Yala is a dusty environment. If you wear contact lenses, consider switching to glasses for the drive.

7. Responsible Tourism Policy
We are committed to the "Leave No Trace" principle.
Distance: We maintain a mandatory 20-meter distance from elephants.
Silence: We switch off engines at major sightings to allow you to hear the sounds of the wild.
No Flash: Flash photography is strictly prohibited as it can blind and agitate the wildlife.

8. Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Is the entrance ticket price included?
A: Yes! On this All-Inclusive page, the price you see covers all government taxes and DWC entrance fees.
Q: What if it rains?
A: Our jeeps are equipped with transparent roll-down rain covers. The animals are often very active during light rain!
Q: Can we see the "Big Three"?
A: While wildlife is unpredictable, the morning safari offers the highest statistical probability of seeing the Leopard, Elephant, and Sloth Bear in a single session.

2.Private All-Inclusive Afternoon Safari
Giants of the Wild & Golden Light: The Ultimate Sunset Expedition
1. Package Overview
The Private All-Inclusive Afternoon Safari is the perfect choice for those who prefer a relaxed start to their day without compromising on world-class wildlife sightings. While the morning belongs to the stealthy hunters, the afternoon in Yala is dominated by the giants. This is the peak time for witnessing majestic elephant herds gathering at waterholes and crocodiles basking in the final rays of the sun.
As a Private tour, you enjoy the exclusivity of your own vehicle, allowing your tracker to focus entirely on your interests—whether that's finding a leopard for the perfect photo or spending time observing a family of elephants. Being All-Inclusive, we take care of all the "gate-work," including your entrance tickets and refreshments, so you can simply soak in the atmosphere.

2. All-Inclusive Pricing Structure
Our afternoon rates are identical to our morning packages, offering premium service with no hidden costs.

3. The Afternoon Itinerary
01:30 PM – The Warm Welcome: Pickup from your hotel in Tissamaharama, Kirinda, or Kataragama. This timing allows you to have a relaxed lunch at your resort before the adventure begins.
02:15 PM – Arriving at the Gate: We head to the Palatupana (Block 1) entrance. While the midday sun is still up, we utilize the drive to scan the shaded forest fringes.
02:30 PM – Entry & The Waterhole Circuit: We prioritize the large tanks like Maha Seelawawa. As the heat begins to break, elephants emerge from the thickets to drink and bathe.
04:00 PM – The "Golden Hour" Photography: The sun begins to drop, casting a warm, orange glow over the plains. This is the best light of the day for capturing the textures of the leopard’s coat or the rugged skin of an elephant.
05:00 PM – Late Predator Surge: As sunset approaches, leopards often descend from trees or granite boulders to begin their evening patrol.
06:00 PM – The Sunset Exit: We depart the park just as the sky turns shades of purple and pink, dropping you back at your hotel by 6:30 PM.

4. Why Choose the Afternoon Safari?
Many seasoned travelers prefer the afternoon slot for three specific reasons:
The Elephant Spectacle: Asian Elephants are highly sensitive to heat. In the afternoon, they move in larger family groups toward the waterholes, providing the best opportunities to see calves playing in the mud.
Unbeatable Lighting: For photographers, the "Golden Hour" in Yala is legendary. The directional light is far more flattering than the harsh midday sun, and the dust kicked up by the jeep creates a beautiful, atmospheric haze.
Leopard Activity: While morning is famous for leopards, the late afternoon (5 PM – 6 PM) is when they wake up from their midday naps and become highly mobile, often walking right alongside the jeep tracks.

5. Your Private Safari Vehicle
Your comfort is our priority during the afternoon heat.
Ventilation: Our open-air TATA/Mahindra 4x4 jeeps ensure a constant breeze while moving.
tiered Seating: Every seat is a "window seat" with an elevated view.
Cooling: Every jeep is equipped with an icebox containing chilled water and refreshments to keep you hydrated.
Expertise: Our trackers are skilled in "patience-based tracking"—knowing exactly which waterhole will likely produce a sighting so you don't have to spend the whole time driving.

6. Wildlife Highlights of the Afternoon
Mugger Crocodiles: You will see dozens of these ancient reptiles basking on the banks of the lagoons with their mouths open (a cooling behavior called "gaping").
Painted Storks & Pelicans: The afternoon light on the lagoons makes birdwatching a vibrant experience.
Wild Water Buffalo: Often seen wallowing in the mud to stay cool.
Spotted Deer: Large herds gather in the open grasslands as the temperature drops.

7. Photography & Packing Tips
Lens Choice: The light fades fast after 5:30 PM. A "fast" lens (with a wide aperture like f/2.8 or f/4) is beneficial for late-day predator shots.
Sun Protection: The first 60 minutes can be quite sunny. Bring a hat and high-SPF sunblock.
Binoculars: Essential for spotting leopards hiding in the high canopy of the Palu trees.

8. Responsible Wildlife Viewing
We take our role as guardians of the park seriously.
Noise Control: We keep our distance and maintain silence around mother elephants and calves to avoid causing them stress.
Flash Prohibition: We never use flash, even as the light fades, to protect the sensitive eyes of nocturnal animals.
Zero Waste: All snack packaging and bottles are brought back out of the park with us.

3.Private All-Inclusive 7-Hour Half-Day Safari
The Predator Quest: Extended Morning & Midday Expedition
1. Package Overview
The Private All-Inclusive 7-Hour Half-Day Safari is specifically engineered for the serious wildlife enthusiast and professional photographer. While standard 5-hour tours often have to turn back just as things get interesting, the 7-hour duration gives you a distinct tactical advantage.
This is the "Sweet Spot" of Yala safaris. It covers the peak predator activity of the early morning and extends into the "Quiet Hours" (9:00 AM – 12:00 PM). During this time, the majority of other jeeps depart, leaving the park peaceful and significantly increasing your chances of witnessing rare behaviors, such as a Sloth Bear foraging or a Leopard shifting its kill, without the interference of large crowds.

2. All-Inclusive Pricing Structure
This package offers the best "price-per-hour" value for dedicated tracking. Everything is included—entrance fees, a private jeep, and a full picnic breakfast.

Children (5–11 years): $26 per child
Infants (Under 5): Free of Charge
What’s Included: Private 4x4 Jeep (7 Hours), DWC Entrance Fees, Naturalist Driver-Tracker, Picnic Breakfast, and Unlimited Bottled Water.

3. The 7-Hour Strategy Itinerary
05:00 AM – The Early Advantage: Pickup from your hotel. We aim to be at the front of the queue to ensure we are among the first to see undisturbed tracks.
06:00 AM – 09:30 AM – High-Intensity Tracking: The primary hunt for leopards and bears while they are still on the move. We explore the core of Block 1.
09:30 AM – 10:15 AM – Extended Beach Breakfast: We take a relaxed break at Patanangala Beach or the Manik River. Enjoy your gourmet breakfast while watching the wildlife near the water.
10:15 AM – 12:00 PM – The "Exclusive" Window: As other jeeps exit, we head into the deeper forest loops and toward Block 5. This is the prime time for Sloth Bear sightings and observing large birds of prey.
12:00 PM – 12:30 PM – Return: We exit the park as the midday heat peaks, returning you to your hotel in time for your own lunch and a siesta.

4. Why the 7-Hour Tour is the Photographer’s Choice
Lower Vehicle Density: Between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the number of jeeps in the park drops by nearly 60%. This silence encourages shy animals to cross the tracks.
The Sloth Bear Factor: Yala’s Sloth Bears are often more visible in the mid-morning hours (8 AM – 11 AM) as they search for termite mounds and Palu fruit.
Behavioral Observation: Instead of rushing to find the next animal, the 7-hour duration allows us to sit quietly at a sighting, waiting for the animal to move, yawn, or interact with its environment—essential for high-quality storytelling through photography.

5. Our Vehicle & Naturalist Standards
Because you will be in the vehicle for a longer duration, comfort is paramount.
Upgraded Jeeps: We use modified TATA/Mahindra 4x4s with high-quality suspension and cushioned tiered seating.
Naturalist Insight: On a 7-hour tour, your driver acts as a naturalist, explaining the intricate relationships between the flora and fauna, the "alarm call" systems of the jungle, and the history of Yala’s ancient civilizations.
Logistics: We carry extra chilled water and refreshments to ensure you stay energized throughout the morning.

6. Wildlife Expectations: The Mid-Morning Shift
Beyond the Big Three, the 7-hour tour is excellent for:
Reptiles: Large Land Monitors and Star Tortoises are frequently seen as they come out to sunbathe.
Birding: This is the best window for spotting the Crested Serpent Eagle, Changeable Hawk-Eagle, and the rare Black-necked Stork near the lagoons.
Primate Activity: Witness the social hierarchies of the Tufted Gray Langurs and Toque Macaques during their peak foraging time.

7. Preparation & Ethics
Comfort: Wear loose, light-colored cotton. A hat is essential as the sun gets higher toward noon.
Batteries: Ensure you have at least two full camera batteries. The extended time means more shutters clicked!
Respecting the Wild: We never "chase" sightings. Our 7-hour success is built on patience and the tracker’s ability to predict animal movement.

8. FAQ
Q: Can we see both Block 1 and Block 5 in 7 hours?
A: Yes, depending on the sightings, our trackers can navigate through the corridors connecting the two blocks to provide a more diverse landscape.
Q: Is breakfast really included?
A: Absolutely. It includes a variety of sandwiches, tropical fruits, boiled eggs, and juice/coffee/tea.

The Ultimate Dawn-to-Dusk Expedition: 13 Hours in the Wild
1. Package Overview
The Private All-Inclusive Full-Day Safari is our most prestigious and comprehensive offering. Designed for the true wilderness connoisseur, the professional photographer, and the traveler who refuses to miss a single moment of jungle drama, this 13-hour expedition is the only way to experience the full ecological narrative of Yala National Park.
While half-day tours are limited to the peripheral tracks, the Full-Day journey allows us to venture into the deep interior of Block 1, navigate the serene corridors of Block 5, and even explore the borders of Lunugamvehera (Block 6). This is not just a drive; it is an immersive tracking marathon where we follow the movements of specific leopard individuals and elephant herds as they navigate their territories throughout the day.

2. All-Inclusive Pricing Structure
Our Full-Day pricing is a flat-rate, all-access pass. It includes everything from high-protein meals to every mandatory government tax and entrance fee.

What’s Included: Private 4x4 Jeep (13 Hours), All DWC Entrance Fees & Service Charges, Expert Driver-Tracker, Picnic Breakfast, Fresh Hot Picnic Lunch, Afternoon Fruits, and Unlimited Bottled Water.

3. The Comprehensive 13-Hour Itinerary
05:00 AM – The Pre-Dawn Pickup: We collect you from your hotel. The early start is critical to secure a leading position at the gate.
06:00 AM – 09:30 AM – The Morning Predator Hunt: We focus on the high-probability leopard areas near Leopard Rock and Kotabandiwewa.
09:30 AM – Riverside Picnic Breakfast: A restorative break at a scenic safe zone.
10:30 AM – 12:30 PM – Deep Jungle Exploration: We push further into the park, away from the standard tourist loops, seeking out Sloth Bears and Sambar Deer.
12:30 PM – 02:00 PM – The Full Picnic Lunch: Unlike shorter tours, we don't leave the park. We serve a hot, fresh Sri Lankan or Western lunch at a designated riverside rest area. This is a time to relax, recharge, and listen to the midday jungle sounds.
02:00 PM – 04:30 PM – The Wetland & Lagoon Circuit: Exploring the watering holes for the afternoon elephant gathering and crocodile activity.
04:30 PM – 06:00 PM – The Golden Hour Finale: A final, focused search for leopards as they begin their evening hunts in the soft, orange light.
06:30 PM – Drop-off: Return to your hotel after a legendary day in the wild.

4. The Strategic Benefit of a Full Day
Why spend 13 hours in a jeep?
The Midday Advantage: Most jeeps exit at 10 AM and don't return until 2 PM. During these 4 hours, the park is nearly empty. This is the "Golden Window" for Sloth Bears and shy leopards who feel safe enough to walk the main roads when the noise subsides.
Tracking over "Spotting": On a short tour, you look for animals. On a full day, we track them. If we see fresh pugmarks, we have the time to wait and anticipate where the predator will emerge.
Maximum Biodiversity: You will traverse at least four different ecosystems: from coastal dunes and marine wetlands to dense thorn scrub and riverine forests, each hosting unique bird and mammal species.

5. Gourmet Dining in the Wilderness
An "All-Inclusive" Full-Day tour is defined by its hospitality.
Breakfast: Fresh bread, eggs, tropical fruits, and hot Ceylon tea or coffee.
Lunch: A curated menu (Vegetarian/Vegan/Halal options available) served hot. Often featuring local rice and curries or specialized picnic wraps, designed to be enjoyed while overlooking the Manik River.
Hydration: An ice-box stocked with unlimited bottled water, fruit juices, and seasonal tropical fruits (like bananas and mangoes) to keep your energy high.

6. Vehicle & Equipment for the Long Haul
Since you are spending 13 hours in the field, we provide our Premium Tier vehicles:
Enhanced Suspension: Modified leaf-spring suspension to handle the deep-rutted tracks of the park's interior.
On-Board Charging: USB charging ports available in the jeep to keep your cameras and phones powered all day.
Binoculars & Field Guides: High-quality binoculars and illustrated wildlife books are provided to help you identify the 215 bird species found in Yala.

7. Professional Photography Support
Our Full-Day trackers are specifically trained to work with photographers:
Positioning: They understand the "Rule of Thirds" and light direction, positioning the jeep so the sun is behind you for the best shot.
Silent Stalls: Using engine-kill techniques early to avoid vibration during long-lens shots.
Patience: We are happy to stay at a single sighting for an hour if it means you get the "action shot" you came for.

8. Responsible Safari Ethics
Extended time in the park comes with extended responsibility:
Zero Litter: We use reusable containers where possible and ensure every scrap of waste is removed.
Engine Management: During the midday break, we ensure the vehicle is parked in a way that does not disturb the natural cooling spots of animals.
Educational Narrative: Your tracker will provide a deep-dive into the conservation challenges facing Yala and the efforts to protect the Sri Lankan Leopard.

Silence: We encourage guests to whisper during sightings to ensure the animals remain calm and the experience remains immersive for everyone.

3.Shared All-Inclusive Half-Day Safari
The Predator Pursuit: 7-Hour Extended Shared Experience
1. Package Overview
The Shared All-Inclusive 7-Hour Half-Day Safari is our most popular "mid-range" option for savvy travelers. While standard morning tours conclude at 10:00 AM, this package extends your time in the wilderness until midday. This 7-hour window is critical because it covers the busy early morning "leopard rush" and moves into the quieter, exclusive mid-morning hours when the majority of other vehicles leave the park.
By joining this shared group (strictly limited to 6 guests), you split the cost of the vehicle and professional tracker while still receiving the full "VIP" treatment. We handle all logistics—from your park entrance tickets to a hearty picnic breakfast—leaving you free to focus entirely on your camera and the canopy.

2. All-Inclusive Shared Pricing
This package is designed to provide the maximum "hours-per-dollar" value. There are no hidden fees to be paid at the gate.
Price per Adult: $60.00
Price per Child (5–11): $26.00
What’s Included: 7 Hours of Safari, Shared 4x4 Jeep (Max 6 pax), All DWC Entrance Fees & Taxes, Picnic Breakfast, and Unlimited Bottled Water.

3. The 7-Hour "Deep Track" Itinerary
05:00 AM – Group Pickup: Prompt pickup from your hotel in Tissamaharama or Kirinda. Meet your fellow adventurers and head straight to the park gate.
06:00 AM – Sunrise Entry: We enter Yala Block 1 just as the gates open. The first three hours are dedicated to high-intensity leopard and sloth bear tracking.
09:00 AM – Picnic Breakfast: We take a 30-minute break at the scenic Patanangala Beach or the Manik River. Enjoy a fresh meal while looking out over the Indian Ocean.
09:30 AM – 12:00 PM – The "Quiet Window": As the 5-hour tours exit, we head deeper into the park. This is the prime time for spotting Sloth Bears foraging and large herds of elephants moving between waterholes.
12:30 PM – Return: Exit the park and return to your hotel for a midday rest.

4. Why the 7-Hour Shared Tour Wins
Exclusivity on a Budget: Between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the number of jeeps in Yala drops by nearly half. This silence makes the animals more relaxed and prone to crossing the road right in front of your jeep.
Increased Sightings: Statistics show that the extra 2 hours (9 AM - 11 AM) are the most productive for seeing the Sloth Bear, which often emerges to feed on termites once the ground warms up.
No Gate Hassle: On shared tours, the driver manages the entrance queue and ticket purchasing. You stay in the vehicle, bypassing the crowded ticket counters entirely.

5. Vehicle & Group Standards
Max 6 Passengers: We never crowd our vehicles. Every guest is guaranteed a "window view" from our tiered-seating safari jeeps.
Professional Trackers: Our drivers are experts in the "alarm calls" of the jungle. They don't just drive; they hunt for sightings using biological clues.
Modified 4x4s: We use high-clearance TATA/Mahindra jeeps with reinforced safety bars and open canopies for 360-degree viewing.

6. What You Can Expect to See
The Big Three: Leopard, Elephant, and Sloth Bear.
Mid-Morning Specialists: Land Monitors, Star Tortoises, and various birds of prey like the Changeable Hawk-Eagle.
Aquatic Life: Mugger Crocodiles and Painted Storks in the lagoons.
Primates: Grey Langurs and Toque Macaques playing in the Palu trees.

7. Preparation Checklist
Clothing: Early mornings are cool, but by 11:00 AM it will be hot. Wear layers and sun protection (hat/sunscreen).
Photography: Bring extra memory cards. 7 hours provides significantly more photo opportunities than a standard tour.
Etiquette: As a shared tour, we ask for "collaborative silence" during sightings so that everyone can enjoy the natural sounds of the bush.

8. FAQ
Q: Is breakfast included in the $60? A: Yes, a full picnic breakfast (sandwiches, fruit, eggs, and water) is included in this all-inclusive rate.
Q: Do we visit different areas than the morning tour? A: Yes. Because we have more time, we can venture into the "interior loops" of Block 1 and the borders of Block 5, which are often too far for the 5-hour tours to reach.

4.Shared All-Inclusive Full-Day Safari
The Complete Yala Expedition: 13-Hour Immersive Shared Journey
1. Package Overview
The Shared All-Inclusive Full-Day Safari is the ultimate choice for the dedicated wildlife traveler on a budget. This is the most comprehensive shared tour available in Yala, spanning a full 13 hours from dawn until dusk. While most visitors only see a fraction of the park, this "marathon" expedition allows you to witness the changing rhythms of the jungle—from the predawn predator hunts to the midday river cooling and the final "golden hour" activity.
By sharing the jeep with a small group of like-minded nature lovers (maximum 6 passengers), you gain access to a full day of expert tracking, two inclusive picnic meals, and deep-park exploration for a fraction of the cost of a private tour. This is the package where "patience pays off," giving you the highest statistical probability of spotting the Big Three: the Sri Lankan Leopard, Sloth Bear, and Asian Elephant.

2. All-Inclusive Shared Pricing
One flat fee covers every aspect of your 13-hour journey. We handle the tickets, the food, and the logistics.
Price per Adult: $85.00
Price per Child (5–11): $26.00
What’s Included: 13 Hours of Safari, Seat in a Shared 4x4 Jeep (Max 6 pax), All DWC Entrance Fees & Taxes, Picnic Breakfast, Fresh Hot Picnic Lunch, Afternoon Fruits, and Unlimited Bottled Water.

3. The 13-Hour "Dawn-to-Dusk" Itinerary
05:00 AM – Group Pickup: Early morning pickup from your hotel. Meeting your group early is essential to be at the gates before they open.
06:00 AM – 09:30 AM – The Morning Rush: We enter Block 1 to catch leopards and sloth bears while the air is cool and tracks are fresh.
09:30 AM – Picnic Breakfast: A hearty breakfast break at Patanangala Beach, overlooking the Indian Ocean.
10:30 AM – 12:30 PM – The "Quiet Window" Hunt: As the half-day jeeps leave, we explore the interior loops. This is often when the rare Sloth Bear is most active, foraging for termites.
12:30 PM – 02:00 PM – Riverside Picnic Lunch: We stop at a designated safe zone by the Manik River. Enjoy a fresh, hot lunch and recharge while listening to the sounds of the jungle.
02:00 PM – 04:30 PM – Wetland Exploration: Focus shifts to the lagoons and tanks to witness elephant herds bathing and crocodiles basking.
04:30 PM – 06:00 PM – The Golden Hour Finale: A final push for leopard sightings in the soft, orange evening light.
06:30 PM – Drop-off: Return to your hotel after a full day of adventure.

4. Why the Full-Day Shared Tour is the Best Value
Maximum Sightings: In wildlife tracking, time is the most important factor. A 13-hour tour triples your chances of seeing elusive predators compared to a standard 5-hour morning tour.
Access to the Deep Park: Because we don't have to rush back for a midday exit, we can venture into the quieter corners of Block 1 and the borders of Block 5, areas where wildlife is less habituated and more "wild."
The "Midday Magic": Between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM, the park belongs to the full-day explorers. With 80% fewer jeeps on the road, animals often venture out onto the tracks, providing intimate, undisturbed encounters.

5. Dining & Comfort in the Wild
Inclusive Meals: Your $85 includes a picnic breakfast and a fresh lunch. We cater to various dietary needs including Vegetarian, Vegan, and Halal (please inform us upon booking).
Tiered Seating: Our shared jeeps are modified TATA/Mahindra 4x4s with elevated rows. Even though it's a shared tour, every seat provides an unobstructed view of the wildlife.
Stay Hydrated: We provide a constant supply of chilled bottled water and seasonal tropical fruits (bananas, mangoes, or wood-apple) to keep your energy up during the heat of the day.

6. Wildlife Expectations: The 13-Hour Cycle
Dawn: Leopard territorial patrols and Sloth Bear movements.
Mid-Morning: Birdfeeding frenzies, reptiles sunbathing, and deer grazing.
Midday: Elephants in the water, Mugger Crocodiles on the banks, and monkeys in the deep shade.
Dusk: Predators waking up for the night hunt and beautiful silhouettes for photography.

7. Preparation for the Long Haul
Power: Ensure your camera batteries are fully charged and you have a backup memory card.
Clothing: Wear breathable cotton. Bring a light jacket for the 5:00 AM start and a hat/sunglasses for the midday sun.
Respect: In a shared vehicle, cooperation is key. We ask all guests to stay seated and keep noise levels to a minimum during sightings.

8. FAQ
Q: Do I need to buy my own ticket? A: No. The $85 includes the DWC entrance fee (approx. $43 value). We handle the entire transaction at the gate while you stay in the jeep.
Q: Is 13 hours too long for children? A: While it is an incredible experience, it is a long day. For families with very young children, we usually recommend our 5-hour or 7-hour options.

Category C: Private Jeep-Only 

1.Private Jeep-Only Morning Safari
Exclusive Vehicle Hire: Your Private 4x4 Morning Expedition
1. Package Overview
The Private Jeep-Only Morning Safari is specifically designed for travelers who prefer to handle their own park entrance logistics—often guests staying at luxury lodges like Cinnamon Wild, Hilton Yala, or Jetwing Yala who may have pre-purchased tickets or vouchers. With this package, you are hiring a premium, modified 4x4 safari jeep and a highly experienced driver-tracker for a dedicated 5-hour morning session.
This is the most flexible way to experience Yala. While we provide the rugged transport and the "jungle eyes" to find the leopards, you retain control over your ticketing costs. Our trackers are locals who have spent decades navigating Block 1, ensuring that even without a pre-set tour, you have the best possible chance of seeing the apex predators at dawn.

2. Private Jeep-Only Pricing
Our pricing is per vehicle, not per person. A single jeep can comfortably accommodate up to 6 passengers.
Price per Jeep (5 Hours): Rs. 15,000 (Approx. $50.00)
What’s Included: Private 4x4 Safari Jeep, Professional Driver-Tracker, Hotel Pickup & Drop-off (Tissamaharama/Kirinda area), and Fuel.
What’s NOT Included: National Park Entrance Tickets (must be paid at the gate in LKR or USD), Meals, and Bottled Water.
Pro Tip: In 2025, the entrance fee for a foreign adult is approximately $25 - $30 plus taxes/service fees. We recommend bringing cash (LKR) for the gate to avoid credit card processing delays.

3. The Jeep-Only Morning Itinerary
05:00 AM – Private Pickup: Your driver will meet you at your hotel lobby. Since the jeep is exclusive to you, there are no other pickups to wait for.
05:45 AM – The Gate Queue: We arrive at the Palatupana (Block 1) gate. Your driver will assist you in navigating the ticket counter if you haven't pre-purchased online.
06:00 AM – Morning Exploration: Five hours of dedicated tracking. You decide the pace—whether you want to stay 30 minutes with one leopard or cover as much ground as possible.
10:00 AM – Exit & Drop-off: We conclude the safari as the park heat begins to rise, returning you to your hotel by 10:30 AM.

4. Why Choose the "Jeep-Only" Option?
Ticket Flexibility: If you are a Sri Lankan resident, a SAARC citizen, or have a special permit, this package allows you to pay the specific lower government rates at the gate.
Expert Navigation: Navigating Yala is difficult. Our drivers aren't just "drivers"; they are trackers who understand the daily movements of the Yala Leopard and the Sloth Bear.
Tiered Seating Comfort: We use modified Mahindra and TATA 4x4s. Unlike standard SUVs, these are built with elevated rows, ensuring every passenger has a clear, 360-degree view over the scrubland.

5. Vehicle Specifications & Safety
Custom Safari Build: Open-top design with a heavy-duty canopy for sun protection.
Tiered Seating: Three rows of elevated seats so your view is never blocked by the driver or the person in front.
Safety Bars: Reinforced steel frames for maximum safety on rugged off-road tracks.
Maintenance: Our jeeps are serviced weekly to ensure no mechanical failures occur deep in the bush.

6. Morning Wildlife Focus
In the 5-hour morning window, your tracker will prioritize:
Predator Patrol: Searching for leopards on the granite "Leopard Rocks."
Sloth Bear Foraging: Looking for bears near the Palu trees (seasonal) or termite mounds.
Early Birds: Witnessing the wake-up calls of the Sri Lankan Junglefowl and the display of the Indian Peafowl.

7. Preparation & Gate Tips
Cash is King: The DWC (Department of Wildlife Conservation) ticket office prefers Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR). While they accept cards, the signal can be weak, causing long delays.
Identification: You must bring your original passport (or a very clear digital copy) for the ticket counter.
Attire: The morning is windy and can be chilly. Bring a light windbreaker or scarf.

8. FAQ
Q: Can the driver buy the tickets for us? A: Yes! If you provide the cash and your passports, the driver can stand in the queue while you wait in the comfort of the jeep.
Q: Is there a limit on how many people can fit? A: Our jeeps are licensed for 6 passengers. For groups larger than 6, you will need to book two separate jeeps for safety and comfort.

As the midday heat fades, the park’s giants—the Asian Elephants—emerge from the deep scrub to gather at the waterholes.

Mugger Crocodiles: Dozens can be seen along the banks of the lagoons, completely still and prehistoric.
Peacock Displays: Witness the vibrant displays of the Indian Peafowl in the open grasslands.
The Sunset Leopard: The final 30 minutes of the safari are the most thrilling, as leopards often use the roads to travel once the temperature drops.

Sun Protection: The first two hours can be quite warm. Bring a hat, sunglasses, and high-SPF sunblock.
Beverages: Since this is a "Jeep-Only" package, remember to bring your own bottled water and any light snacks you may want.

3.Private Jeep-Only 7-Hour Half-Day Safari
The Exclusive Predator Pursuit: Extended Vehicle Hire for Wildlife Specialists
1. Package Overview
The Private Jeep-Only 7-Hour Half-Day Safari is the elite choice for professional photographers, birdwatchers, and serious wildlife enthusiasts who require more time in the field than a standard tour allows. This package provides you with a dedicated, modified 4x4 safari jeep and an expert driver-tracker for a full 7-hour duration (typically 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM).
By choosing the "Jeep-Only" option, you maintain control over your own park entrance fees and catering. This is the preferred package for guests who want to avoid the "9:00 AM rush" when most 5-hour tours exit the park. Between 9:30 AM and 12:00 PM, Yala becomes significantly quieter, allowing for intimate, undisturbed encounters with the Sloth Bear and Leopard in the deeper interior tracks.

2. Private Jeep-Only Pricing
Our pricing is a flat vehicle rate for up to 7 hours of tracking. This is one of the most cost-effective ways to get professional-grade tracking time.
Price per Jeep (7 Hours): Rs. 17,000 (Approx. $55.00)
Capacity: Up to 6 Passengers.
What’s Included: Private 4x4 Safari Jeep, Expert Driver-Tracker, Hotel Pickup & Drop-off, and Fuel.
What’s NOT Included: DWC Entrance Tickets, Food, and Water.
Gate Advice: For a 7-hour tour, ensure you purchase your tickets at the gate for the "Morning" session. The ticket is valid for a single entry. We recommend having your Passport ready for the DWC officials.

3. The 7-Hour "Deep Track" Itinerary
05:00 AM – Priority Pickup: Your private jeep arrives at your hotel. No shared stops mean you are at the gate early to beat the crowds.
06:00 AM – The Sunrise Hunt: The first three hours are high-intensity. We scan the "Leopard Rocks" and sandy crossings while the air is still cool.
09:30 AM – The "Quiet Window" Advantage: As the standard 5-hour jeeps exit the park, we head deeper into the interior loops. This is the prime time for the Sloth Bear and large Asian Elephant bulls.
11:00 AM – Rare Birding & Reptiles: We utilize the late morning light to explore the lagoons for the Black-necked Stork and massive Mugger Crocodiles.
12:00 PM – Exit & Return: We conclude the safari just as the midday sun reaches its peak, returning you to your hotel by 12:30 PM.

4. Why the 7-Hour Private Hire Wins
Lower Jeep Density: The final 2 hours of this tour (10 AM - 12 PM) are the most peaceful. With 60% fewer vehicles on the road, shy animals are more likely to stay in the open.
Tracking Patience: On a 7-hour hire, you don't have to rush. If we find a leopard in a tree, we can wait 45 minutes for it to descend—something impossible on a shared or shorter tour.
Expert Naturalist Drivers: Our drivers for the 7-hour sessions are our most senior trackers. They understand the nuances of alarm calls and pugmark tracking needed for extended sessions.

5. Vehicle Specifications
Open-Top 4x4: Modified TATA or Mahindra jeeps for maximum visibility.
Tiered Seating: Elevated rows ensure every passenger has a clear view, especially important for long-lens photography.
Rugged Reliability: Our jeeps are equipped to handle the deep mud and sandy river crossings of Yala’s interior.

6. Target Wildlife: The 7-Hour List
The Big Three: Leopard, Elephant, and the elusive Sloth Bear.
Rare Birds: Changeable Hawk-Eagle, Crested Serpent Eagle, and Malabar Pied Hornbill.
Mammals: Sambar Deer, Golden Jackal, and the Ruddy Mongoose.

7. Essential Preparation
Ticketing: You must pay your own entrance fees. Bring approximately LKR 12,000 - 15,000 per person to be safe, depending on current exchange rates and taxes.
Supplies: Since this is "Jeep-Only," please pack your own breakfast/snacks and at least 2 liters of water per person.
Gear: Bring extra camera batteries. Seven hours of tracking often results in 500+ photos!

8. FAQ
Q: Can we stay later than 12:00 PM? A: This specific package covers a 7-hour block. If you wish to stay until sunset, we recommend the Full-Day Private Jeep (14-Hour) package.
Q: Where do we eat? A: Your driver will stop at a designated "Safe Zone" (like Patanangala Beach) where you can get out of the jeep and enjoy the food you have brought.

This package provides you with a dedicated, high-performance 4x4 safari jeep and a veteran driver-tracker for a 14-hour marathon (5:00 AM – 7:00 PM). By choosing the "Jeep-Only" model, you maintain total control over your itinerary and entrance tickets. This is the only way to witness the full 360-degree story of the jungle—from the predawn predator patrols to the midday river wallowing and the final, high-drama evening hunts.

Since you are staying all day, you only need to pay this once. We recommend carrying cash in LKR for the fastest gate processing.

3. The 14-Hour "Deep Jungle" Itinerary
05:00 AM – The Exclusive Start: Pickup from your hotel. With a private jeep, you are not waiting for other guests, ensuring you are at the front of the queue.

10:00 AM – 01:00 PM – The "Midday Ghost" Hours: While 90% of jeeps exit the park, we venture into the quietest interior loops of Block 1 and Block 5. This is the best time for undisturbed Sloth Bear sightings.

05:00 PM – 06:30 PM – The Final Hunt: Tracking predators in the golden evening light as they begin their nightly territorial patrols.
07:00 PM – Return: Drop-off at your hotel after a legendary 14-hour expedition.

4. Why Hire a Full-Day Private Jeep?
Patience Pays Off: Wildlife photography is 90% waiting. With a 14-hour hire, we can wait at a waterhole for two hours for a leopard to come down for a drink—a luxury not possible on shared or half-day tours.
Access to Remote Zones: Because we don't need to return to the gate for a midday exit, we can travel to the furthest corners of Block 1 and the borders of Block 5, where human activity is minimal and wildlife is more relaxed.
Maximum Light Opportunities: You get both the "Blue Hour" of dawn and the "Golden Hour" of dusk, ensuring you have the best possible lighting for your portfolio.

5. Vehicle & Naturalist Standards
Premium 4x4 Jeeps: We use our best-maintained Mahindra and TATA vehicles for full-day sessions to ensure maximum comfort on the rugged tracks.

Batteries: Bring at least 3 camera batteries and multiple memory cards.
Comfort: Wear light, breathable clothing and bring a wide-brimmed hat. A small cushion for the seat can be a lifesaver on a 14-hour drive!

8. FAQ
Q: Can we leave early if we get tired? A: Absolutely. It is your private jeep. If you've seen the "Big Three" by 3 PM and want to head back for a swim, the driver will take you back whenever you wish.
Q: Do we have to pay extra for Block 5? A: No, the jeep-only fee covers the vehicle's time regardless of which accessible block you choose to explore.

Unbeatable Photography Light: The "Golden Hour" (4:30 PM – 6:00 PM) in Yala is legendary. Even on a budget tour, you get the high-contrast, warm lighting that professional photographers crave.
Elephant Peak: Afternoon safaris statistically offer the most reliable elephant sightings as they move toward the lagoons to cool off before nightfall.

5. Vehicle & Group Standards
Modified Safari Jeeps: We use specialized TATA and Mahindra 4x4s. These are open-air vehicles with high ground clearance for the rugged Yala terrain.
Guaranteed Side View: We limit the jeep to 6 passengers. With our tiered-seating layout, every passenger has a "window view" for unobstructed viewing and photography.
The Expert Tracker: Our drivers aren't just chauffeurs; they are trained naturalists who know the subtle signs—like a fresh leopard paw print in the dust—to find the animals you came to see.

6. Afternoon Wildlife Highlights
Mugger Crocodiles: Watch dozens of these ancient reptiles basking on the lagoon banks.
Tuskers: Late afternoon is the best time to spot Yala's rare and majestic "tuskers" (elephants with tusks).
The "Sunset Leopard": Experience the thrill of a leopard stretching on a granite rock as the temperature drops.
Birding Spectacle: Watch thousands of birds (like Painted Storks and Pelicans) returning to their roosts at sunset.

7. Preparation Checklist
ID Requirement: You must bring your original Passport (or a clear digital copy) for the Department of Wildlife Conservation ticket office.
Sun Protection: The first two hours are sunny. Bring a hat, high-SPF sunblock, and sunglasses.
Hydration: Since this is a "Jeep-Only" tour, please pack your own bottled water (at least 1.5L per person).

8. FAQ
Q: What is the maximum number of people in the jeep? A: We never exceed 6 passengers. This ensures everyone is comfortable and has enough space to take photos from both sides of the vehicle.
Q: Do I need to book in advance? A: Yes, especially for shared tours. We need to coordinate with other solo travelers to fill the vehicle. We recommend booking at least 24-48 hours ahead.

3.Shared Jeep-Only Half-Day Safari
The 7-Hour Value Expedition: Extended Tracking for Independent Travelers
1. Package Overview
The Shared Jeep-Only Half-Day Safari is specifically designed for the budget-conscious traveler who understands that more time in the jungle equals more sightings. While standard 5-hour tours often end just as the rare Sloth Bear or a shy Leopard begins to move, this 7-hour session (5:00 AM – 12:00 PM) keeps you in the park through the "Golden Window" of mid-morning.
By booking a seat-only package, you avoid the high markups of all-inclusive bundles. You share the vehicle with a small group of fellow explorers (maximum 6), dividing the cost of a premium 4x4 and a professional tracker. This is the ultimate "independent" package: you pay for your own entrance tickets and bring your own food, but you get the elite tracking expertise required to find Yala’s most elusive residents.

2. Shared Jeep-Only Pricing
We offer a flat-rate per seat, ensuring you get the best "price-per-hour" value in Tissamaharama.
Price per Person: Rs. 6,000 (Approx. $20.00)
What’s Included: One Seat in a Shared 4x4 Safari Jeep (7-Hour Session), Professional Driver-Tracker, and Hotel Pickup/Drop-off (Tissamaharama/Kirinda).
What’s NOT Included: National Park Entrance Ticket, Breakfast, and Water.
Budgeting for the Gate: You will need to pay the DWC (Department of Wildlife Conservation) entrance fee in person. In late 2025, a 7-hour or half-day ticket for a foreign adult is approximately $30 - $35 (approx. LKR 13,000 - 15,000) including all taxes. We recommend bringing cash in LKR to the ticket counter.

3. The 7-Hour "Deep Track" Itinerary
05:00 AM – Group Pickup: Our driver collects you from your accommodation. We gather the group quickly to ensure we are among the first jeeps in the morning queue.
06:00 AM – Sunrise Entrance: We enter Block 1. The first three hours are high-intensity, focusing on the fresh pugmarks left by leopards during the night.
09:00 AM – Social Breakfast Break: We stop at Patanangala Beach or the Manik River. Since this is "Jeep-Only," you can enjoy the breakfast box you brought from your hotel while swapping sightings with other travelers.
09:30 AM – 11:30 AM – The "Quiet Window": As the 5-hour jeeps exit, we explore the interior loops. This is the prime time for Sloth Bear sightings and observing large Asian Elephant bulls.
12:00 PM – Exit & Return: We conclude the safari as the midday heat peaks, dropping you back at your hotel in time for a nap.

4. Why the 7-Hour Seat is the Best Budget Choice
Exclusivity Without the Price Tag: Between 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the number of jeeps in Yala drops significantly. You get a "private park" feel while only paying for a shared seat.
Tracking over Spotting: Most budget tours just drive the main roads. Our 7-hour trackers have the time to venture into the "deep loops" of Block 1 and the borders of Block 5 where the rarest wildlife hides.
Social Connectivity: You'll spend 7 hours with five other travelers. It’s a fantastic way to meet people and share the cost of a high-end safari vehicle.

5. Vehicle & Group Standards
Modified 4x4 Jeeps: We use TATA and Mahindra safari vehicles with open tops and reinforced safety bars.
Guaranteed Window View: We never put more than 6 people in a jeep. Because our seating is tiered (stadium-style), every passenger has an unobstructed view over the side of the vehicle.
Expertise: Your driver is a local tracker who understands the "alarm call" language of the jungle—essential for finding predators once the morning rush ends.

6. Wildlife Focus: The Extended Window
The "Mid-Morning" Bear: Sloth Bears are often seen foraging for termites between 9 AM and 11 AM.
The Resting Leopard: With fewer jeeps around, leopards are more likely to remain visible on the granite boulders rather than retreating into the thicket.
Reptile Activity: Witness large Land Monitors and Star Tortoises as they emerge to sunbathe.

7. Preparation Checklist
ID & Cash: Bring your original Passport (or a clear digital copy) and approximately LKR 15,000 for the park entrance fees.
Food & Supplies: Pack a hearty breakfast, some snacks, and at least 2 liters of water. Tissamaharama guesthouses usually provide "Safari Breakfast Boxes" if you ask the night before.
Sun Gear: It will be very hot by 11:00 AM. Bring a hat, sunglasses, and a light long-sleeved shirt for sun protection.

8. FAQ
Q: What if the park is crowded? A: Our trackers are experts at "counter-flow" driving—heading to the areas that the other jeeps are avoiding to ensure you get a peaceful experience.
Q: Do I pay the driver for the ticket? A: No, you pay the government officials directly at the ticket window. The driver will show you exactly where to go and help you with the forms.

4.Shared Jeep-Only Full-Day Safari
The Ultimate Budget Marathon: 14 Hours of Professional Tracking
1. Package Overview
The Shared Jeep-Only Full-Day Safari is designed for the absolute wildlife enthusiast who wants the maximum possible time in the park for the lowest possible price. This 14-hour session (5:00 AM – 7:00 PM) offers the highest statistical probability of seeing Yala’s most elusive residents, including the Leopard, Sloth Bear, and Elephant, by covering the park's entire daily wildlife cycle.
By sharing a professional 4x4 with other travelers, you split the vehicle costs while maintaining the expertise of a veteran tracker. This is a "seat-only" hire; you manage your own entrance tickets and food, making it the premier choice for photographers and backpackers who want a deep-dive expedition without the luxury-package price tag.

2. Shared Jeep-Only Pricing
We offer a simple, flat-rate per seat for this 14-hour journey.
Price per Person: Rs. 8,000 (Approx. $26.00)
What’s Included: One Seat in a Shared 4x4 Safari Jeep (14 Hours), Veteran Driver-Tracker, and Hotel Pickup/Drop-off (Tissamaharama/Kirinda).
What’s NOT Included: National Park Entrance Ticket, All Meals, and Water.
Gate Budgeting: For a full-day visit, you only need to purchase one ticket at the gate. As of late 2025, a foreign adult ticket is approximately $42 - $45 (approx. LKR 13,000 - 14,500) including all mandatory government taxes and 15% VAT. Cash (LKR) is strongly recommended for the fastest processing at the gate.

3. The 14-Hour "Marathon" Itinerary
05:00 AM – Group Pickup: Early morning pickup to ensure your group is at the gate before sunrise.
06:00 AM – 10:00 AM – Morning Intensity: We track predators during their peak activity hours.
10:00 AM – 01:00 PM – The "Midday Secret": As the standard 5-hour jeeps exit, we explore the deep interior. This is the best time for Sloth Bear sightings.
01:00 PM – Riverside Break: We stop at a safe zone (Manik River or Patanangala). Enjoy the breakfast and lunch you’ve packed while watching the river wildlife.
02:00 PM – 05:00 PM – The Afternoon Surge: We focus on waterholes to witness the gathering of elephant herds and crocodiles.
05:00 PM – 06:30 PM – The Golden Hour: A final push for leopard sightings in the amber evening light before the gates close.
07:00 PM – Return: Drop-off at your hotel after a legendary day of wildlife exploration.

4. Why the Full-Day Shared Seat is a Game Changer
Triple the Tracking Time: A standard morning tour gives you ~4 hours of actual park time. This package gives you 12+ hours, dramatically increasing your chances for rare encounters.
Quiet Midday Window: Between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM, Yala is nearly empty of other vehicles. This silence encourages shy leopards and bears to move across the roads.
Maximum Photo Opportunities: You get the benefit of both the dawn "Blue Hour" and the dusk "Golden Hour," ensuring your portfolio has the best possible light.

5. Vehicle & Safety Standards
Modified 4x4s: We use high-clearance TATA/Mahindra jeeps with tiered, stadium-style seating so everyone has a clear view.
Veteran Drivers: We assign our most patient and experienced trackers to full-day tours, as they require superior knowledge of animal behavioral patterns over 14 hours.

6. Preparation Checklist
Mandatory ID: Bring your Passport for the gate.
Food & Supplies: You must bring a breakfast box, a lunch box, and at least 3-4 liters of water per person.
Power & Storage: Bring extra camera batteries and an empty memory card—you will take more photos than you think!
Clothing: Early mornings are cold; midday is very hot. Wear layers and bring a hat and high-SPF sunblock.

7. FAQ
Q: Can I book this as a solo traveler? A: Yes! We will pair you with other travelers. If we cannot fill the minimum seats, we will contact you to discuss a private upgrade or an alternative date.
Q: Is there a toilet on the way? A: Yes, we stop at designated park rest areas (Manik River or Patanangala Beach) which have basic restroom facilities.
